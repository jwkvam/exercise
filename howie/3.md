## 3.1

### Problem

Show t hat a closed interval $[a,b]$ on the real line is a closed subset of $\mathbb{C}$, but that an open interval $(a, b)$ is not an open subset of $\mathbb{C}$. Is it closed?

### Solution

The open interval $(a,b)$ is neither closed nor open.

## 3.2

### Problem

Show that the set $A = {z \in \mathbb{C} : 1 < |z| < 2}$ is open. Describe its closure and its boundary.

### Solution

It's the intersection of two open sets which is open. It's a ring bounded by 1 and 2.
